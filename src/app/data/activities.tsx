          The AUX workshop hosts would like to thank everyone who attended the
          2026 Accelerate UX Workshop! We had a great time meeting people and
          learning about the different approaches to UI/UX and software
          development at everyone’s facility. We would ask if you have a moment
          to please respond to this quick survey about the workshop (want
          something different at the next workshop? Here’s your chance to let us
          know!)
        </p>
        <p>
          We have also uploaded some videos and slides from the AUX group on the
          indico page, to view them go to the timetable and click the paperclip
          icon next to the session. ALS staff took lots of great photos that you
          can check out on the Google album. If you did not receive this email,
          but need the link to the survey or photos, please reach out to the AUX
          working group.

        <p>
          In late Feb 2026, staff from 11 different accelerator lab facilities
          gathered at the Advanced Light Source for a 3 day event, the
          “Accelerate UX Workshop”. What could bring together so many different
          participants from across the US and abroad? The answer is simple: a
          chance to improve the user experience for operators, scientists,
          engineers, researchers, and all others who work at accelerator labs.
